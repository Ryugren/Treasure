Simple drag and drop "MainDoor" located in the "Assets/RockDoor/Prefabs" into hierarchy and use it as you want.
The "DoorStone" (child of "MainDoor") has two separated meshes, so you can manipulate them individually.

If you want to add some rocks to your project just drag and drop the "GroundRock" located in the "Assets/RockDoor/Prefabs" into you hierarchy.
Tip: be sure to variate the scale and rotation to give more naturalist look if you use many ground rocks.

The terrain is just for demo purposes, but you can use it in your scene if you like it.
